ITP449 Final Project

Marketing is making use of data analytics more frequently. I am taking a marketing class this semester, and I realized that marketing analytics is a growing area that still has a lot of potential. In this project, I will take a look at the Dummy Marketing and Sales Data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/harrimansaragih/dummy-advertising-and-sales-data).

I will perform analysis on the correlations between marketing budgets and the sales revenue, and build up a model for predicting the sales revenue using those factors.

There are 4572 rows of data and 5 columns. Here are some details about the columns:

* TV: TV promotion budget (in million)
* Radio: Radio promotion budget (in million)
* Social Media: Social Media promotion budget (in million)
* Influencer: Whether the promotion collaborate with Mega, Macro, Nano, Micro influencer
* Sales: Sales revenue(in million)
